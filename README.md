<h1 align="center">ðŸŒŠ River Charts ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰</h1>

**River Charts** is a `Python`, `Django`, `Plotly`, and `Pandas` web application that visualizes river data for a specific river/site/location.
- The line graph is driven by data pulled using an `API` from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/).
    - The data is captured by the **USGS** using a [gage height](#gage-height) sensor every 15 minutes.
- The data is updated with the most recent river height data every time the application is loaded.
    - Please be patient, the loading time of the application is around 30+ seconds (depending on your internet connection), due to the large `API` `JSON` response and the amount of data being processed from the USGS.
    - The application can be configured to pull live data in via the `API` or use a static `.json` file to display a snapshot of data.
- The loading screen screen contains fun wave and tube graphics as well as 20 "Fun Facts" regarding Tubing and Rivers on a 7 second interval to keep the user occupied while the data is loading in the background. 
- I recommend using the application on a desktop since the chart is interactive has a wider view, but it can be used on a mobile device as well.
- Visit the application [here](https://scottgriv.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Background Story

Every year, my friends and I float 2 miles down the **Susquehanna River** in **NEPA** on river tubes (a 2 hour float). I wanted to create a web application that would allow us to visualize past river data in order to see the river height on the days we floated down the river. Some float dates, we still got together, but we didn't float due to the dangerous river levels. 

Below is the key to use when viewing the plots on the graph for Float dates:

| Color         | Hex                                                                | Floated Status                          | Floated Key |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Green         | ![#008000](https://via.placeholder.com/10/008000?text=+) `#008000` | Yes (Met up and did Float)              | Y           |
| Red           | ![#FF0000](https://via.placeholder.com/10/FF0000?text=+) `#FF0000` | No (Met up, but did not Float)          | N           |
| Orange        | ![#FFA500](https://via.placeholder.com/10/FFA500?text=+) `#FFA500` | Skipped (Skipped the event altogether)  | S           |


> [!NOTE]
> The closest river gage to our float location is the [Susquehanna River at Meshoppen, PA](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?01533400), which is the default site code in the application. 
> You can change the site code in the application `config.py` file to visualize data for a different river/site code.

## Definitions

Here are some definitions to help you understand the terminology used in this document:

- <ins><b>USGS</b></ins>: The United States Geological Survey. The USGS is a science organization that provides impartial information on the health of our ecosystems and environment, the natural hazards that threaten us, the natural resources we rely on, the impacts of climate and land-use change, and the core science systems that help us provide timely, relevant, and useable information.
    - [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/)
- <ins><b>Gage Height</b></ins>: The height of the water surface above the gage datum (zero point). Gage height is often used interchangeably with the more general term, stage, although gage height is more appropriate when used with a gage reading. Stage is more appropriate when used with a recorded or calculated gage height.
    - [Gage Height](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/gage_height/)
    - [Why does the USGS use the spelling "gage" instead of "gauge"?](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-does-usgs-use-spelling-gage-instead-gauge#:~:text=Newell%20is%20purported%20to%20be,influence%20added%20a%20'u')

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project makes use of several libraries and frameworks:
- **Python:** For the application logic.
- **Django:** For web application functionality.
- **Plotly:** For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Requests:** For making `API` calls.
- **Python-Decouple:** For storing sensitive information in a `.env` file.
- *See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for a full list of dependencies.*

### Configuration

- Edit `config.py` to add your own USGS `API` (and other) information.
    - [USGS API](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html)
    - [USGS API Documentation](https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/faq/automated-retrievals)
- Toggle `USE_DUMMY_DATA` to `True` in `config.py` to use dummy data instead of the `API`.
    - This is useful for testing the application without making `API` calls.
- Toggle `USE_SNAPSHOT_DATA` to `True` in `config.py` to use snapshot/static data instead of the `API`.
    - This is useful for avoiding `API` calls and using a static data set in the `data/snapshot.json` file.
    - You will need to populate the file with `JSON` by calling the "Historical River Levels" `API` call in `Postman`, included in this project (`docs/api/River Charts.postman_collection.json`); see [Calling the API](#calling-the-api) below for more information.
    - Your app will esentially be a snapshot, and not live updates using this method, but it can be helpful if you want to avoid server costs making `API` calls.
- The float data plots are driven from a `.csv` file located in `static/data/river_charts.csv`.
    - This file can be edited to add/remove float dates.
    - The file is read in `views.py` and passed to the template as a `context` variable.

## API Documentation

Below is the documentation for the `API` used in this application.

### Calling the API

To call the `API` and retrieve the data:

1. Make a `GET` request to: `http://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/...` (based on your requirements).
    - ex. `https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv?format=json&sites=01533400&startDT=2015-07-01&endDT=2023-08-16&parameterCd=00065&siteStatus=active&siteType=ST`
2. Pass the necessary parameters in the request.
    - ex.
    ```python
    params = {
        "format": "json", # Set your interchange format.
        "sites": "01533400", # Site Code: Susquehanna River at Meshoppen, PA.
        "startDT": "2015-07-01", # Set the date you want to start collecting data from.
        "endDT": "2023-09-14", # This is based on the current date in the application.
        "parameterCd": "00065", # Parameter Code: Gage height, ft.
        "siteStatus": "active", # Selects sites based on whether or not they are currently active. Each USGS Water Science Center determines whether a site is active or inactive. The default is all (show both active and inactive sites).
        "siteType": "ST", # ST = A body of running water moving under gravity flow in a defined channel. The channel may be entirely natural, or altered by engineering practices through straightening, dredging, and (or) lining. An entirely artificial channel should be qualified with the "canal" or "ditch" secondary site type.
    }
    ```

    - [Codes and Parameters](https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters)

3. Process the JSON response as demonstrated in the example above.

**Notes:** 
- The application uses the `API` to source data for the graph. If the `API` is down, the graph will not render.
- Errors are handled in the application by redirecting the user to an error page with the appropriate error message.
    - `HTTP` errors are handled in the application by redirecting the user to an error page with the appropriate error message.
    - The application will also display an error message if the `API` returns an empty response or a timeout error (default is set to 90 seconds in `config.py`).
    - The `API` is rate limited to 30 calls per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429` error.

### API Output Example

The application sources data using an `API` that returns `JSON` output. Here's an example of what the API response looks like:

```json
{
    "name": "ns1:timeSeriesResponseType",
    ...
    "timeSeries": [
        {
            "sourceInfo": {
                "siteName": "Susquehanna River at Meshoppen, PA",
                ...
            },
            "variable": {
                "variableName": "Gage height, ft",
                ...
            },
            "values": [
                {
                    "value": [
                        {
                            "value": "15.13",
                            "dateTime": "2015-07-01T00:00:00.000-04:00"
                        },
                        ...
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
